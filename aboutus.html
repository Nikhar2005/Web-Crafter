                        <h2>Our Story</h2>
                        <p>WebCraft was born out of a passion for web design and a desire to create engaging, accessible
                            entertainment for people of all ages. Our journey began in a college dorm room, where we
                            brainstormed ideas for a project that would not only serve as our capstone but also address
                            a real-world problem.</p>
                        <p>Our idea was born out of our own frustrations with existing web design tools. We wanted
                            something that was user-friendly, intuitive, and flexible. With this in mind, we set out to
                            build WebCraft, a platform that embodies our values of simplicity, creativity, and
                            inclusivity.</p>
